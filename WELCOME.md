# 🧠 Welcome to Agentic MCP Crawler

## What makes this agentic?

Unlike traditional web scrapers that blindly follow instructions, this system **thinks strategically** about how to find what you need:

```
🧠 User Intent Analysis  →  📋 Strategy Selection  →  🔄 Adaptive Execution  →  📈 Continuous Learning
```

### ✨ Intelligent Features

### 🚀 Quick Start

# 1. Set up your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Launch the agentic server

```
