Your Deal Hawk app can now use **agentic intelligence** to find deals!

## Quick Integration

### 1. Install in Deal Hawk App

```python

from deal_hawk_mcp_client import find_deals_for_product, discover_trending_deals

# Find deals intelligently
deals = await find_deals_for_product(
    product_name="gaming laptop RTX 4060",
    max_price=1200.0,
    categories=["electronics", "gaming"]
)

# Each deal includes:

# - confidence_score, discovered_at
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

# Add to your Deal Hawk .env
AGENTIC_CRAWLER_URL=https://your-railway-deployment.up.railway.app
```

### 3. Smart Deal Finding Examples

```python
# Natural language deal queries
deals = await find_deals_for_product("cheap wireless earbuds under $50")
deals = await find_deals_for_product("discounted mechanical keyboards")
deals = await find_deals_for_product("Black Friday laptop deals")

# Discover trending deals
trending = await discover_trending_deals("electronics")
trending = await discover_trending_deals("fashion")
```

## How It Works

### üß† **Intelligent Deal Finding Process:**

1. **Query Analysis**: Claude analyzes your deal request
2. **Strategy Selection**: Chooses optimal crawling approach
3. **Site Discovery**: Finds relevant deal sites automatically
4. **Smart Extraction**: Identifies prices, discounts, products
5. **Result Ranking**: Sorts by confidence and relevance

### üîç **What Gets Extracted:**

- Product names and descriptions
- Current prices vs original prices
- Discount percentages and savings
- Deal expiration dates
- Special offers and promotions
- Product availability status

### üìä **Structured Results:**

```python
@dataclass
class DealSearchResult:
    title: str                    # "Gaming Laptop RTX 4060"
    price: str                    # "$999.99"
    original_price: str           # "$1299.99" 
    discount: str                 # "23% off"
    url: str                      # Direct product link
    description: str              # Product details
    source: str                   # Site crawled
    confidence_score: float       # 0.0 - 1.0 relevance
    discovered_at: datetime       # When found
```

## Integration Examples

### Basic Deal Hawk Integration

```python
async def search_deals_for_user(user_query: str, max_budget: float = None):
    """Integrate into your existing Deal Hawk search"""
    
    try:
        # Use agentic intelligence to find deals
        deals = await find_deals_for_product(
            product_name=user_query,
            max_price=max_budget
        )
        
        # Convert to your Deal Hawk format
        deal_hawk_results = []
        for deal in deals:
            deal_hawk_results.append({
                'title': deal.title,
                'price': deal.price,
                'discount': deal.discount,
                'url': deal.url,
                'confidence': deal.confidence_score
            })
            
        return deal_hawk_results
        
    except ConnectionError:
        # Fallback to your existing deal finding logic
        return await fallback_deal_search(user_query)
```

### Enhanced Deal Discovery

```python
async def enhance_deal_hawk_with_agentic_discovery():
    """Add proactive deal discovery to Deal Hawk"""
    
    categories = ["electronics", "fashion", "home", "books", "sports"]
    
    all_trending_deals = []
    for category in categories:
        trending = await discover_trending_deals(category)
        all_trending_deals.extend(trending)
    
    # Show users: "We found these trending deals you might like"
    return all_trending_deals
```

### Deal Hawk Dashboard Integration

```python
class DealHawkDashboard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp_server_url = os.getenv('AGENTIC_CRAWLER_URL')
    
    async def get_smart_deals(self, user_preferences: dict):
        """Personalized deal finding with agentic intelligence"""
        
        # Build query from user preferences
        query = self._build_query_from_preferences(user_preferences)
        
        # Find deals using agentic crawler
        deals = await find_deals_for_product(
            product_name=query,
            max_price=user_preferences.get('max_budget'),
            categories=user_preferences.get('categories')
        )
        
        # Filter and rank based on user history
        personalized_deals = self._personalize_deals(deals, user_preferences)
        
        return personalized_deals
    
    async def get_price_alerts(self, tracked_products: list):
        """Monitor prices intelligently"""
        
        price_updates = []
        for product in tracked_products:
            current_deals = await find_deals_for_product(product['name'])
            
            # Check if price dropped
            if current_deals and self._price_dropped(product, current_deals[0]):
                price_updates.append({
                    'product': product,
                    'new_deal': current_deals[0],
                    'savings': self._calculate_savings(product, current_deals[0])
                })
